## What Is FastPeopleSearch and Why Is Your Data There?

FastPeopleSearch is a free people-lookup site that pulls information from:

- Public records (property records, voter data, court filings)
- Marketing databases
- Other data broker platforms
- Online and offline sources legally allowed to resell data

Even if you never created an account, your data can still appear. Simply being listed in public records is enough.

This creates serious **privacy and safety risks**, including:
- Identity theft
- Phishing and scam targeting
- Stalking or harassment
- Employment and background-check issues

---

## What Information Does FastPeopleSearch Show?

A typical FastPeopleSearch profile may include:

- Full legal name and aliases
- Current and previous addresses
- Phone numbers (mobile & landline)
- Approximate age and date of birth
- Names of relatives and associates

All of this information is publicly visible — and indexed by Google.

## FastPeopleSearch Opt-Out: Step-by-Step Removal Guide

FastPeopleSearch does offer a manual opt-out process. Here’s how to remove your information directly from the site.

### Step 1: Find Your Listing
Go to **FastPeopleSearch.com** and search for:
- Your full name
- City and state (optional but helpful)

Locate your exact profile and open it.

---

### Step 2: Copy the Profile URL
Once your profile page is open, copy the **full URL** from your browser’s address bar.

---

### Step 3: Visit the FastPeopleSearch Opt-Out Page
Scroll to the bottom of the FastPeopleSearch website and click **“Remove My Record”**, or go directly to their removal form.

Paste your profile URL into the opt-out form.

---

### Step 4: Submit Your Email Address
You’ll be asked to enter an email address to receive a confirmation link.

> **Tip:** Use a secondary or alias email to avoid further data collection.

---

### Step 5: Confirm the Removal Request
Open the confirmation email from FastPeopleSearch and click the verification link.  
Without this step, your request will **not** be processed.

---

### Step 6: Wait for Removal
Most listings are removed within **24–72 hours**, though some may take longer.

---

## Will Your Data Come Back After Removal?

Yes. FastPeopleSearch regularly re-imports data from its sources. Even after a successful opt-out, your profile may reappear weeks or months later.

Common reasons include:
- New public records
- Updated broker datasets
- Address or phone number changes

---

## Manual Removal vs Automated Data Removal Services

Manual removal works for single sites like FastPeopleSearch.  
However, most people are listed on **dozens or hundreds** of data broker websites.

Automated services help by:
- Handling removals at scale
- Repeating opt-outs automatically
- Monitoring for re-listings

---

## Final Thoughts

FastPeopleSearch removal is possible, but it’s rarely permanent without monitoring. While manual opt-out works short term, **automated data removal services provide long-term protection** across the broader data broker ecosystem.

Your personal data has value — make sure **you**, not data brokers, stay in control.
